#### Description
This API is an add-on to my project 1 that would allow user to save their words and retrieve later. 

#### Challenges
I was having difficulties setting up the data structure that would store the data on the backend. I decided to use Map.


#### Learning outcomes
1. Learned to use params and query from the request object
2. Learned to manipulate JavaScript objects
3. Learned about different HTTP response codes and use it appropriately in my backend.
4. Learned about express middlewares.

#### What's next? 
1. I want to connect the backend to a database server, like MongoDB or relational database
2. I want to setup a username and password authentication for the app
3. Add ability to remove words
