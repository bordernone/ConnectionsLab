It is a simple web based calculator app for now. My idea is to create an advance calculator app that can solve complex equations.

1. Created two event listeners: one for tracking input changes and another one for listening to button click events.
2. Attached each events to respective handlers

### Learning outcomes

1. Learned to reference to DOM elements from JavaScript
2. Learned how to change DOM elements' attributes using JavaScript.
3. Learned about different type of JavaScript events and when they are triggered.
4. Learned to extract different attributes, like input value, from event object.
5. Also learned about CSS `:hover`, `:focus`, etc.
