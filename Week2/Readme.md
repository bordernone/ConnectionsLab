### Idea
It is a simple web based calculator app for now. My idea is to create an advance calculator app that can solve complex equations.

### Progress

1. Created two event listeners: one for tracking input changes and another one for listening to button click events.
2. Attached each events to respective handlers

### Challenges

1. The biggest challenge with this web app is parsing the mathematical expression and generating the result. The solution I have used for now is, sort of, a workaround and it is potentially dangerous. This web app is part of a bigger idea and I will be writing a better algorithm to take care of computing the result.
2. Had difficulties understanding the `input` and `onchange` event for `<input>` element; Used online resources to figure out which one is needed for this app. 

### Learning outcomes

1. Learned to reference to DOM elements from JavaScript
2. Learned how to change DOM elements' attributes using JavaScript.
3. Learned about different type of JavaScript events and when they are triggered.
4. Learned to extract different attributes, like input value, from event object.
5. Also learned about CSS `:hover`, `:focus`, etc.
