### Description
The idea is to create something similar to "word cloud" that displays words that are related to the phrase/word that user types. It can be used for multiple purposes. Essentially, this API processes four major queries: for a given input X, one can find words that are similar to X, words that sound like X, words that are spelled like X, or words that are related to X. Use of wildcard, prefix, suffix are few extensions to this API. Furthermore, the words have a score associated with them which tells how the word is related to the user's entered text.


### Usage Guide
1. User enters a word or phrase in the input field.
2. User clicks the generate button.


### Status
- [x] Initialize the project with an html, a javascript, and a css file.
- [x] Add input field and buttons. 
- [x] Fetch data from the api and process the response (also display).
- [ ] Use p5js to display array of words as word cloud and set their size and color according to the word's score.


### Ideas that could be implemented in the future
- [ ] User can select words from word cloud and it would display other info.
- [ ] User can select words from word cloud and export it as a file

### Challenges
- None so far
