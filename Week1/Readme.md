### Idea
My app is simple portfolio webpage. For now, the webpage only displays user's profile picture and a short description. A video is also attached to the site which is played continuously (muted). The navbar is not functional yet as this is a single page app and there is no script attached.

### Progress

1. Created prototype on Figma.
2. Converted Figma design into webpage

    a. Downloaded the required images to the project directory

    b. Created and linked main.css file to the index.html file

    c. Added necessary `<div>` tags to build the overall skeleton

    d. Added CSS code to the body tag to set background image and the font

    e. Created a div with .main CSS class name which acts as content container

    f. Set max-width for .main class name such that it doesn't stretch components beyond what's necessary.

    g. Added flex property to nav bar making each links equally spaced and vertically aligned to the middle.

    h. Added video and hid the controls. Made the video loop infinitely

### Learning outcomes

1. Learned to use CSS flex property.
2. Learned to use images and videos in html
3. Learned how videos can be set to auto-play when page is loaded and keep looping infinitely.
4. Learned to use custom image as the background for the entire page
